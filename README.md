# WaddleOS

This is an educational operating system I'm developing. The goals and methods are as follows:
- As much as I can should be developed on my own.
- Tests should be run wherever possible to verify the functionality works all the time, not just in certain cases.
- Should be able to run DOOM when complete, as well as a host of other applications as I see fit to develop for utility. This may include examples such as a notepad, browser, paint app, or really whatever I think would be fun to make.
